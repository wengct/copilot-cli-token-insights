# 🤖 GitHub Copilot CLI Token Insights Dashboard

[繁體中文版 (Traditional Chinese Version)](./README.md)

This is a local token consumption and session analysis dashboard designed specifically for **GitHub Copilot CLI**. Powered by a high-performance **Rust (Axum)** backend and a beautiful **dark glassmorphic (Glassmorphism)** frontend, it helps you easily monitor daily token cache hit rates, reasoning token consumption, and **reconstruct/restore the historical conversation timeline of every session**!

## 🤖 Agent Quick Start Prompt
If you want another AI agent or automation flow to set this up quickly, paste this more complete prompt:

```text
Please install and launch GitHub Copilot CLI Token Insights Dashboard in this environment using the local-first workflow described in this README.

Goal:
- Install and start this Rust/Axum project locally.
- Configure GitHub Copilot CLI statusLine so it writes token usage data into the local ~/.copilot directory.
- Confirm the dashboard is available at http://localhost:3000.

Please complete the following steps in order:
1. Confirm that the current working directory is the project root and that shell/statusline-token.sh exists.
2. Verify that the Rust toolchain is installed; if not, install it with rustup.
3. Run cargo build --release to build the release binary.
4. Create or confirm that ~/.copilot exists, then copy shell/statusline-token.sh to ~/.copilot/statusline-token.sh.
5. Make the script executable with chmod +x ~/.copilot/statusline-token.sh.
6. Update ~/.copilot/settings.json:
   - If the file does not exist, create a new JSON file whose top-level value is a valid JSON object and include a statusLine block.
   - If it already exists, preserve the existing settings and merge the statusLine block into it; keep the original JSON structure intact and do not turn it into an array or another non-object format.
   - The statusLine command should point to ~/.copilot/statusline-token.sh using the actual home directory path (for example, from echo $HOME).
   - Be careful with the JSON structure: the top level must be an object `{}`, `statusLine` must also be an object, and the file must remain valid JSON with proper commas and quotes.
   - Example `statusLine` configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "statusLine": {
         "type": "command",
         "command": "$HOME/.copilot/statusline-token.sh",
         "padding": 1
       }
     }
     ```
7. Validate the setup:
   - Run echo '{}' | ~/.copilot/statusline-token.sh to confirm the script executes successfully.
   - Run jq . ~/.copilot/settings.json, or use python -m json.tool if jq is unavailable, to verify the JSON is valid.
8. Restart Copilot CLI or open a fresh Copilot CLI session so the statusLine configuration takes effect.
9. Return to the project root and run cargo run to start the dashboard.
10. Confirm that the terminal output includes http://localhost:3000 and that the URL is reachable in a browser.
11. If a custom Copilot data directory is used, set COPILOT_DIR before launching the app so it points to the correct .copilot folder.

Notes:
- This project is local-first; do not assume any remote API or external service.
- If any step fails, stop and report the exact error message and the command that failed.
- After completion, provide a short summary including whether startup succeeded, whether the URL is reachable, and any caveats.
```

## 🚀 Setup & Launch

All data is parsed and rendered entirely on your local machine, ensuring absolute data privacy and security. Follow these steps to configure and launch:

### Phase 1: Data Collection Configuration

The dashboard visualizes data streamed from the **GitHub Copilot CLI** status line to a local collection script.

#### 1️⃣ Install Rust Environment
In your terminal (Linux / WSL2 / macOS), execute the official installer:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Installation Prompt**: When prompted with the installation menu, simply press **`Enter`** to select `1) Proceed with standard installation (default)`.

After installation, load Rust environment variables:
```bash
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```
*(Verify installation: Run `cargo --version`. It should display the installed cargo version.)*

#### 2️⃣ Deploy the Data Collection Script
Create a local config directory, copy the script from the project to `~/.copilot`, and grant execution permissions:
```bash
# Create directory and copy script
mkdir -p ~/.copilot && cp shell/statusline-token.sh ~/.copilot/statusline-token.sh

# Ensure script is executable
chmod +x ~/.copilot/statusline-token.sh
```

#### 3️⃣ Edit Copilot CLI Settings
Open or create the configuration file with your editor:
```bash
nano ~/.copilot/settings.json
```
For a **brand new configuration**, paste the following:
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "$HOME/.copilot/statusline-token.sh",
    "padding": 1
  }
}
```
If you **already have existing configurations**, merge the `statusLine` block into it:
```json
{
  "footer": {
    "showDirectory": true,
    "showBranch": true
  },
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "$HOME/.copilot/statusline-token.sh",
    "padding": 1
  }
}
```
> [!NOTE]
> **Home Directory Hint**: Replace the `command` value with `$HOME` or your actual home directory path (run `echo $HOME` in terminal to check it).

#### 4️⃣ Restart & Verify
1. **Restart Copilot CLI**: Exit the current Copilot CLI session and re-enter to apply the new settings.
2. **Verify Status Line**: Upon starting a session, you should see a beautifully rendered status line at the bottom:
   ```text
   🤖 Auto → GPT-4o • #1 • ↑ 22.8k • c 22.0k/0 • ↓ 61 • r 29 • total 22.9k • +22.9k • last 22.8k/61 • ctx 9%
   ```
3. **Troubleshooting Tools**:
   - standalone script test:
     ```bash
     echo '{}' | ~/.copilot/statusline-token.sh
     ```
   - JSON validation test:
     ```bash
     jq . ~/.copilot/settings.json
     ```

---

### Phase 2: Start the Dashboard

Navigate to the project root directory and run:

```bash
cargo run
```
> [!NOTE]
> During the first launch, Cargo will download dependencies and compile the binary locally (takes 1~2 minutes). Subsequent starts take less than 1 second offline.

Once the terminal displays the success message:
```text
🚀 GitHub Copilot CLI Token Insights Dashboard is running on: http://localhost:3000
```
Open [**`http://localhost:3000`**](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to start exploring!

---

### Phase 3: Run as a Background Service (systemd)

To run the dashboard as a background service without keeping a terminal open, we recommend using user-level `systemd` services:

#### 1️⃣ Compile a Release Build
For optimal performance and minimal memory usage, compile a release binary:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

#### 2️⃣ Configure systemd Service
We have provided a service file template. Register it with your system using the following commands:
```bash
# Create systemd user configuration directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/

# Replace the template directory path and copy to systemd directory
sed "s|<PROJECT_DIR>|$PWD|g" shell/copilot-insights.service > ~/.config/systemd/user/copilot-insights.service

# Reload systemd configuration
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

#### 3️⃣ Start & Enable the Service
```bash
# Start the service
systemctl --user start copilot-insights.service

# Enable the service to start on boot
systemctl --user enable copilot-insights.service
```

> [!TIP]
> **Enable Background Linger**:
> User-level services stop when you log out of your SSH/terminal session. To run them persistently in the background, enable `linger` on your system:
> ```bash
> sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
> ```

#### 4️⃣ Service Management Commands
* **Check service status**: `systemctl --user status copilot-insights.service`
* **Check live logs**: `journalctl --user -u copilot-insights.service -n 50 -f`
* **Restart service**: `systemctl --user restart copilot-insights.service`
* **Stop service**: `systemctl --user stop copilot-insights.service`

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Configurations

#### Customizing Data Paths
The dashboard automatically searches for your default `~/.copilot` folder. If your Copilot CLI data is saved at a custom location, specify it using the `COPILOT_DIR` environment variable before running:

```bash
export COPILOT_DIR="/your/custom/path/.copilot"
cargo run
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why do individual conversation turns in the session drawer only show "Out" and "Total", but no "In" (Input) tokens?

**A:** This is not a dashboard limitation, but rather a **design choice of GitHub Copilot CLI's local event logging**:
1. **Turn Event Limits**: In the Copilot CLI local `events.jsonl` files, the `assistant.message` event logs only record the **`outputTokens`** produced by that specific reply. They do not record `inputTokens` or cache stats for that individual turn.
2. **Session Aggregated Summary**: Copilot CLI only aggregates and records the total input tokens, cache read/write tokens, and reasoning tokens of the entire conversation when you **end the session** (i.e. writing the final `session.shutdown` event).
3. **Frontend Fallback**: To display total tokens per turn, the frontend calculates `inTokens + outTokens` as a fallback. Since `inTokens` is absent (parsed as 0), the `Total` matches the `Out` value, and the empty `In` badge is automatically hidden to keep the interface clean.
